# Image Resizer with Zag Crop

This project is a React-based image editor that leverages the powerful `@zag-js/image-cropper` library to provide robust image cropping functionalities. Users can upload an image, then utilize a variety of tools to precisely crop, zoom, rotate, and flip the image both horizontally and vertically. Once satisfied with the adjustments, the cropped image can be saved and previewed within the application.

## Key Features:

*   **Image Upload:** Easily load images into the editor.
*   **Interactive Cropping:** Define a specific area of the image to keep.
*   **Zoom Functionality:** Adjust the zoom level for precise cropping.
*   **Rotation:** Rotate images by 90-degree increments.
*   **Flipping:** Mirror images horizontally or vertically.
*   **Live Preview:** See the cropped image in real-time before saving.
*   **Save Cropped Image:** Export the final cropped image.
